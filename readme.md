#Library System

This was a semester long group project for my Software Modeling class in college. The purpose of the project was to teach us through experience how to design a system from the ground up using UML and them implementing it. Each member of the group was given a role such as Project Manage and QA analyst. I was given the role of Programmer, which meant that in the end ~95% of the code was written by me. 

## Project Specifications

The original specification is as follows:

>Your task is to create a system that will allow a library to more smoothly conduct business with their patrons. Using todayâ€™s advanced database technology, this system will be able to create a detailed report of every item that is checked out, reserved, late or lost, along with all vital information about the item (i.e.: Author, Title, etc.). The combination of this information with the ability for customers to view their personal status will create a much more self-aware library organization.

## The Code
This was my first experience creating a desktop application using Java. At this point I had a year of Java (Android) experience working for my co-op, so I had a bit of knowledge going in. I did however make some rookie mistakes such as opening an entire new window instead of transitioning screens. This means if you run the application, by the time you're done you'll have nearly a dozen windows open.

Even though the app isn't pretty, it fulfilled the requirements and we passed the project.
